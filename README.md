## Problem Statement
Customer segmentation is a technique in which we divide the customers based
on their purchase history, gender, age, interest, etc. With the help of this project,
companies can run user-specific campaigns and provide user-specific offers
rather than broadcasting same offer to all the users.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a companyâ€™s customers into
groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. The goal of
segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in
order to maximize the value of each customer to the business.
Customer segmentation has the potential to allow marketers to address each
customer in the most effective way. Using the large amount of data available on
customers (and potential customers), a customer segmentation analysis allows
marketers to identify discrete groups of customers with a high degree of accuracy
based on demographic, behavioral and other indicators.

## Objectives
  -  To enable the company to differentiates its customers according to their
needs.
  -  To allow a company to increase its over all efficiency by focusing on potential
customers.
  -  To maximize the value of each customer to the business.
  - To allows marketers to identify groups of customers with a high accuracy
based on demographic, behavioral aspects.

## Technology
### Machine Learning <br/>
Machine learning is the concept that a computer program
can learn and adapt to new data without human intervention. Machine learning
is a field of artificial intelligence (AI).
we are using ML algorithms to classify the customers on the basis of
various features.

## Software Requirement 
  - Python Language
  - Jupiter Notebook
  - Python Libraries
  - scikit-learn
  - seaborn
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

## Advantages
  - Benefits for both customers as well as Company.
  - Allows customer to personalize their purchase.
  - Helps company to retain their customers.
  - Maximize the Sell.
  - Better targeting the customers.
